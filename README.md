This is an app to use for fetching a list of a character's appearances from the DC Database Wiki.
It allows for sorting the lists, currently only alphabetical order and publication date are implemented.

# Goals

- More sorting criteria.
- The ability to filter by appearance type.
- The ability to search for shared appearances of multiple characters, i.e. all issues that feature Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman.

# Releases and Updates
