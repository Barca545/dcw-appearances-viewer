"Superman Vol 3 28","Lois was chasing a story in the Suicide Slum alongside a police squad, when they were ambushed by a group of mobsters. When one of the cops is shot in the arm, Lois uses her new psychic powers to paralyze the criminals.

Meanwhile,  Superman has discovered a doorway hovering above Earth's orbit. Dr. Shay Veritas contacts Superman and both talk about what to do with the door. Veritas suggests monitoring until they know more.

Superman returns to his apartment and takes off his armor. Suddenly, Clark detects someone on the living room with his X-ray vision. Clark barges into the living room with a baseball bat and finds Jimmy sleeping on his couch. As Jimmy wakes up, Clark asks why did he return if he has a lot of money. Jimmy answers that he does not feel comfortable living like a billionaire and wants to feel normal again. Clark allows him to stay on his apartment as long as he likes. But then, someone knocks on the door. It's Cat and she has news for Clark.

Meanwhile, at Washington D.C., General Lane has spent the night with a woman named Gladys. Then, someone breaks into his house and holds Gladys hostage. A second person holds Lane at gunpoint but Lane throws a knife into his hand and grabs his gun. The stranger tells him that he can tell him everything he needs to know about the Tower.

Cat tells Clark that Morgan Edge was interested in buying their website. Clark persuades Cat not to accept the offer and Jimmy tells them Edge and his company must be interested in their blog because they must be a close a story they do not want out there.

Later, Clark goes to the police precinct to write a story about the incident in Suicide Slum. He finds Lois in the precinct and asks her if she is okay. Lois hugs Clark and leaves, surprising him.

Meanwhile, Red Hood and the Outlaws had established their headquarters on an island in the South Pacific. Roy Harper, aka Arsenal, is eating ice cream until their base's sensors go off. Starfire is shocked by this and flies away, thinking Earth is in danger.

Back at the precinct, Superman interrogates one of the mobsters who were in Suicide Slum. The mobster is unimpressed, saying his group has a benefactor that gave them the power to destroy him. Superman uses his X-ray vision to check his equipment, looking at some sort of ""living glass."" In that moment, an explosion hits the precinct. It's Starfire, and she has come to pick a fight.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Superman_Vol_3_28"

While they do remember Wally, they don't know anything about the life he had. Nor do they remember Linda Parks. She doesn't remember Wally either, and after receiving a visit from him babbling about how in love they used to be, she starts researching the new Flash. 
While that is happening, the Titans, except for Lilith and Wally, because Lilith is still digging in Wally's head for clues, start researching the threat that made them forget Wally. Roy confesses to Donna that he used to be a junkie.

The Flashes end up smashing through that barrier, and they put Green Lantern in danger. In giving off to much Speed Force Energy, Barry angrily throws Wally into a building, to which Wally responds that he knew Barry was there to save him, which is why he does not understand why Barry will not help him save his kids. Barry questions Wally if there could be consequences to going into the Speed Force and breaking it. Wally questions Barry when he stopped trusting him, and Barry says that he never did. Barry asks Wally what he wants him to do, and Wally tells him that he wants him and Barry to run into the Speed Force and to smash the other side. As they run into the Speed Force, Barry tells Wally that they both have been lost in the Speed Force before, to which Wally responds that they are each other's lightning rods. As they are running inside the Speed Force, Wally races past Barry, and smashes through the other side. The resulting occurrence leads to the breaking of the Force Barrier, and Barry and Wally falling out of the sky. As Barry and Wally were pulled into Central City, the Justice League appears, and are suddenly knocked out by Zoom, who has gained access to the Speed Force, the Strength Force, and the Sage Force. as Barry and Wally are subdued by Zoom, Hunter sets out to finally get what was lost to him.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flash_Vol_5_49"

"Superman Vol 5 9","Superman has a strange dream of the future, a future in which he and his family have brought peace to the entire world. All of Superman's friends and allies have gathered around the city of Metropolis to celebrate World Peace Day, honoring Man of Steel's countless accomplishments for humanity and the galaxy. Even the House of Zod has come to pay their respects to Superman. Unfortunately, joy gives way to tragedy, as a mysterious enemy group begins killing Superman's friends left and right.

Superman is suddenly thrown back to the waking world, causing Lois and Jon to ask if he has slept recently. Superman tells his family that he is alright and that Kryptonians do not need to sleep, as the yellow sun constantly replenishes their energy. After hearing about what happened to Jon, Superman tells him that he traveled to a parallel world inhabited by evil and corrupt versions of the Justice League. These people call themselves the Crime Syndicate, and they brought ruin to their own in their constant power grabs and battles.

''The Crime Syndicate immediately attacked Superboy, but amazingly, Ultraman defended him from the other supervillain. Jon initially felt safe in the arms of a man who resembled his father, but his sense of comfort did not last long. As soon as the other supervillains were out of sight, Ultraman threw Superboy into a volcano, where he questioned the scared and confused boy about where he came from. Ultraman already knew Superboy was from another universe and told the boy he was Clark Kent, just like his father. Ultraman had already fought Superman quite a few times in the past and still expressed interest in conquering his world. Until then, Superboy would remain here in Earth-3. This volcano would be his home from now on. Superboy attempted to escape but without sunlight to replenish his powers, he was trapped.''

Superman and Lois are horrified upon learning what happened. Superboy thought Jor-El would save him, but he didn't even know if he was alive.

''During Superboy's imprisonment at the volcano, Ultraman would bring him food and occasionally, he would make fun of Superboy for his devotion to his father and even attack him. But as time passed, Ultraman stopped hurting Superboy and instead, he forced him to listen to stories about his life. According to Superboy, Ultraman had no real friends, no one to show him even the slightest hint of respect. There where even times were Ultraman cried and left Superboy alone, and a long time would pass before Superboy saw Ultraman again. Superboy knew that if he was going to escape, he would have to wait until Ultraman cried, and then, he would escape in his absence. When the time came, Superboy used the last of his power to smash the side of the volcano with a boulder. The plan worked, and Superboy escaped through the crack and into the city below.''

''Superboy eventually made his way to Crime Syndicate's headquarters, hoping to find something there that would get him home. Unfortunately, Superboy was ambushed by a woman that so closely resembled his mother: Superwoman. Angry, Superwoman screamed she would do what her weak husband was unable to do: kill Superboy.''","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Superman_Vol_5_9"

"Infinite Frontier Vol 1 1","On Earth 23, a space capsule crash lands in the middle of a field. An elderly couple find it and discover a wounded and unconscious Batman inside, but not the Batman of their world. Realising he must come from another world in the Multiverse they call their son Calvin Ellis, aka Superman, the President of the United States and leader of Justice Incarnate.

Meanwhile on Earth 0 the Totality are fighting Extant, who is trying to manipulate the timeline. Newest member Alan Scott hits him with an energy construct of a train before he can do any damage. Alan has to rush off as he is already late to an appointment with his children. In Gotham City he meets up with his son Obsidian, who is also running late, and they head to the old JSA headquarters where Jade is waiting for them. Just before they go in, an explosion of green energy rips through the building. The two switch into their costumes and run in looking for her, but Todd's psychic link to Jennie has been severed and he has no idea where she has gone.

In Paris, Director Bones tracks down Cameron Chase to reactivate her. Now that the Multiverse is common knowledge the DEO has been reinstated and is working to prevent another trans-dimensional event. Chase initially refuses but is forced to accept when Bones shows her something on his phone.

At the Hall of Heroes, Batman wakes up. He is an alternate version of Thomas Wayne from a timeline accidentally created by the Barry Allen of Earth 0. He needs to talk to Barry but he is currently away on a mission, trying to use his superspeed to travel to the new reality Earth Omega. Barry races across the known 52 realities and eventually manages to jump to Earth Omega, where he finds the dead bodies of the Quintessence. Before he can investigate he is attacked by the Psycho-Pirate, who has been granted new powers by Darkseid. Psycho-Pirate tells Barry that another crisis is coming, and Barry will help them find the person Darkseid needs.

"The Flash 2021 Annual Vol 1 1","Tomorrow -- Wally sits on the toilet in costume, talking to himself about a phrase Roy Harper told him -- ""Don't leave before the miracles happen"" -- the meaning of it, while one of his kids beg for him to finish up so they can go.

Now -- In the Speed Lab, Michael figures that the tachyon pulse they sent into the Speed Force should slow it down just enough for Wally to dislodge whatever's stuck in it. Ollie asks what happens if they don't, Barry saying they'd just simply lose an integral force of nature. Barry asks Wally if he sees what may be lodged in the Speed Force and Wally believes he does. He tries to grab it, only to be sucked in and tossed back towards Sanctuary, where he sees the bodies of those he killed airborne. As he stands there, Wally realizes the truth: he wasn't the one who killed the heroes, it was the Speed Force's bursts.

After recovering, Wally tells the others in the Lab that everyone's in a strange bubble of Speed Force and thinks he can pull them out. They tell him 'no', that doing so would destroy the world. As he tries to figure out what's going on, a voice calls out to him, showing Roy outside the bubble, unaffected. Wally goes to hug Roy in relief, only for the former Titan to see the bodies in the air. Despite Barry telling him that not to, Wally tells Roy that he caused it, or at least the Speed Force responded to him.

In the Speed Lab, Ollie sees Roy and despite Barry and Michael telling him that they can't, Ollie begs them to call someone to save Roy. Barry warns that he tried to and caused the Flashpoint. Even worse, Barry finds out that his Speed Force connection is gone as Michael notices a fluxuation in the Speed Force. In the past, Wally explains what happened and how it lead to where they are now. Despite a lot of it going over Roy's head, he notices the time bubble shrinking.  Turning, the two are shocked at who has stepped out -- Savitar, donning a brand new costume and vowing to take revenge on whoever imprisoned him.

Somehow, Savitar has a connection to the Speed Force and is trying to absorb it for himself. Wally races in to stop him, but Savitar easily catches and slams him onto the ground. Roy fires an arrow at Savitar, who catches and and has it explode in his face. When Barry warns Wally of what Savitar is doing, the two former Titans charge him, only to be knocked away. Savitar explains that he hadn't been killed in his last encounter with the Flash, but instead trapped in a dark prison. Somehow, a small spark of the Speed Force found its way to him and he harnessed its power, believing he had been chosen by the power. However, the Speed Force reacted and sent surge after surge to loosen Savitar from its grasp, but failed. However, Wally's interference distracted him, leading to the two of them being deposited in this time frame.

In the Speed Lab, Michael suggests, to stop Savitar, popping the time bubble and having Wally drag Savitar back into the Speed Force and back to the lab. Ollie realizes that they're going to still kill everyone, though Michael points out that if they don't, Savitar drains the Speed Force and dooms the Omniverse. Once again, Ollie begs Wally to save Roy, but he just can't. Barry tells Wally the plan and Roy catches on. Despite Wally's pleas, Roy tells Wally that he can let go of the guilt, that they didn't die because he killed them and that they died because of Savitar's actions. Realizing Ollie is watching, Roy sends out one last message to his former mentor, thanking him for all he's done and telling him that he was the best dad he ever had before firing another arrow into the bubble, sucking the energies, Savitar and Wally's conscience back inside the past Wally. With a final farewell to Lian, the past Wally unleashes the energy, killing everyone.

In the present, the trio in the Lab are suited up and having just witnessed Roy's sacrifice, Ollie grieves. Superman and Batman arrive and Barry quickly informs them of what's going on. Seconds later, Savitar and a naked Wally are spat out, with Savitar focusing on the League. Superman flies in, telling him they don't have to fight, but Savitar is just too fast for him and he's knocked out. Ollie and Michael attempt to fight, but neither they or Batman can stop him. Barry checks on his protege and gives him a Flash Ring, telling him he's the only one to take Savitar out. The villain grabs Barry by the neck and believes he's the one to imprison him. However, a weakened Wally knocks them away, suited up in his classic costume and tells Savitar he understands why the Speed Force chose him and sent him to other places and figures he's also here to stop him. As if to prove a point, the Speed Force strikes Wally with a bolt of lightning. Super-charged, Wally launches himself out of the Lab with Savitar in tow.

Savitar realizes Barry has a raw connection to the Speed Force, but it changes nothing. Wally tells him that he has a three-second head start to start running before he shows him what it means. Savitar takes it and Wally easily catches up to him, striking the villain and severing his connection to the Speed Force. As Wally rejoices in his victory, the Justice League catches up to him, watching as Savitar is seemingly dragged back to his prison. Suddenly, adrenaline of all the action fades out and Wally passes out.

Sometime later, Wally is back on his feet, healthy and whole. Barry explains that they wanted to tell Linda, but decided not to, only for Wally to figure out that Linda figured out everything and now no one wants to answer her. Barry suggests that maybe they can try again with severing Wally's connection again, but Wally rebuffs him, understanding that he can't give up when the going gets touch. When Wally asks if he can go home, Michael says he can, but the charge by the Speed Force is still inside him. They want to run more tests, but Wally declines. Before he leaves, Ollie stops Wally and hugs him, apologizing for his actions.

With everything settled, Wally returns to Linda and the kids with a new sense of hope and redemption.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flash_2021_Annual_Vol_1_1"
"Infinite Frontier Vol 1 2","On Earth 0, Cameron Chase goes to the Hall of Justice to speak to Superman and Batman. She tells them that after the latest Crisis people are afraid, and not content to just trust the heroes will take care of it. An alarm cuts the conversation short and Superman carries Cameron out of the Hall and flies away at superspeed before she can react. Director Bones calls her and tells her to contact the recently returned Captain Atom and recruit him to the D.E.O..

Meanwhile, Justice Incarnate are gathering the pieces of the interdimensional prison ship which Thomas Wayne escaped from. The ship somehow crashed and the debris was scattered across the Multiverse. Wayne remembers being abducted from Arkham Asylum on Earth 0 by X-Tract and managing to fight his way to an escape shuttle, but he doesn't know what happened after that. Harbinger alerts him and President Superman that a large chunk of the ship has been detected on Earth 22, but their contact is not responding. The two head to Earth 22 and are attacked by Magog, who was previously reformed but appears to have been reverted to villainy by the recreation of the Multiverse.

Back on Earth 0, Alan Scott has called in the Totality for help after his daughter's disappearance. Mister Terrific tells Obsidian that many people associated with the JSA or Infinity, Inc. have mysteriously disappeared, something the Totality have been keeping secret from the superhero community. Todd is frustrated by the lack of action and insists on interrogating their old enemy Vandal Savage, who rudely tells Alan to get rid of Todd as he is not part of the Totality. Angered, Alan blasts Savage away and resigns from the Totality, and father and son head off to look for Jennie.

Meanwhile, Roy Harper is trying to figure out how to use his new Black Lantern ring. Remembering some advice Hal Jordan gave him when he was a child, Roy activates the ring and flies into the air. He creates a construct of a bow and some targets shaped like his old enemies and practices his aim, annoyed that one of his shots is slightly off the bullseye. He asks the ring why he was chosen, and in response it creates a huge energy construct, showing the faces of Darkseid, the alternate Thomas Wayne, Barry Allen, Psycho-Pirate and Lian Harper. However the construct shows Lian as a teenager, when she supposedly died as a young child. Roy realises Lian is alive and demands the ring tell him where she is, but suddenly he hears Darkseid's voice in his mind and the ring takes control of him. His face changes to the typical corpselike appearance of a Black Lantern and the Corps symbol on his chest transforms into an Omega, and he flies off to answer Darkseid's call.

At Metropolis Air Force Base, Chase meets with Captain Atom and asks him how he is alive, when he supposedly died during the events of ''Death Metal''. Atom claims to have been restored to life when the Multiverse was remade and declines her offer to join the D.E.O, as he has decided to retire. Chase appeals to him based on their history together, although they have never met before. He reminisces with her about a supposed mission they went on that never actually happened, confirming her suspicions that he is an alternate version of Captain Atom from another reality. When she confronts him he reveals that he is trying to hide out from Darkseid on Earth 0, and now that he has been found he breaches his own containment skin, creating a nuclear explosion that seemingly kills them both.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Frontier_Vol_1_2"

"Infinite Frontier Vol 1 3","Green Lantern and Obsidian have broken off from the Totality and are searching for Jade the proactive way, hunting down each of Alan's old enemies in turn and beating them up for information. The eventually make their way to the reformed Shade, who suggests that one of Todd and Jennie's enemies may be responsible.

Meanwhile, the possessed Roy Harper is flying into space in answer to Darkseid's call. His desire to find his daughter allows him to break the ring's control, but he is left stranded in orbit. If he uses his ring to get back to Earth it will possess him again, so he decides to simply wait for a cosmic hero to pass by and pick him up. He is quickly located by a spaceship which takes him on board.

On Earth 22, President Superman and the Flashpoint Batman are attacked by Magog when they try to investigate the crashed ship. Superman assumes Magog has reverted to villainy, but Magog states he simply wants to keep dangers from the multiverse off his world. The rest of Justice Incarnate arrives to provide backup, but Superman orders them to stand down before the fight can escalate and tells Magog they simply want to investigate the wreck and leave, which he agrees to. Batman remembers how Barry Allen told him that every parallel world had it's own vibrational frequency, and suggests the wreckage may react to something from its own world. The heroes each place their hands on the wreck and it vibrates where Superman touches it, indicating the ship is originally from Earth 23.

On Earth Omega, Barry believes he has entered the Speed Force and is racing to save the Multiverse, but this is an illusion created by the Psycho-Pirate, he is in fact spinning a gigantic turbine. In the distance he sees a running figure begging for help and speeds up to reach them.

Back on Earth 0, Alan and Todd sneak into DEO bunker Command D, as Todd suspects Director Bones may be involved. He confesses to his father that he has always felt overshadowed by Jade, who was more confident and a natural leader, while he always struggled with interpersonal relationships, however since he found his partner Damon he has found it easier to connect to people. He also tells Alan that Damon has a friend he would like to set Alan up with, but Alan believes he is too old to start dating and is still not over his lost love Jimmy Henton.

They spot Bones and realise Todd's hunch was correct. Bones is supervising the construction of a “Carrier Ark”, a huge flying prison ship. Green Lantern and Obsidian are attacked by X-Tract, who is working for the DEO. They fight off her and her henchmen, but are shot by Cameron Chase, who is somehow alive.

The ship which picked up Roy is revealed to be another Carrier Ark, under the command of “Agent Hammond”. Hammond tells Roy that the DEO's mandate has been expanded to deal with interdimensional invaders and people back from the dead. DEO agents attack Roy with sonic weapons which prevent him focusing to use his ring. Roy suddenly realises that Agent Hammond is Hal Jordan's old enemy Hector Hammond, restored to normal by the changes to reality. Hammond takes the ship into the Bleed, telling Roy the DEO have made a deal with someone to hand him and his ring over.

Suddenly the ship begins rocking with impacts, and Hammond realises that they are being attacked by something within the Bleed, which should be impossible. The agents restraining Roy are distracted and he uses his ring to overpower them, creating a construct of Hal to punch Hammond in the face. Unfortunately, the ring starts to possess him again and the attackers, a team of JSA members led by Jade, burst up through the floor. They assume Roy is a zombie from an alternate world in the Omniverse and attack him.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Frontier_Vol_1_3"

As Superman and Batman fight their way through Luthor's defences they each question the other's personal choices: as Batman believes Superman's devotion to his roles as superhero and president have cost him a chance for a family; while Superman tells Batman he should attempt to reconcile with his son, but Thomas thinks he hurt Bruce too much for that to be possible. They break into Luthor's inner sanctum to find him dead with his heart ripped out, and the plans for the Carrier Ark.

On Earth 0, the DEO are loading Green Lantern and Obsidian into a Carrier Ark. X-Tract will take them and the ship to rendezvous with Hector Hammond at Earth Omega. They lost contact shortly after he reported that he had captured Roy Harper but are still able to track the Ark. It's revealed that X-Tract saved Cameron Chase from the alternate Captain Atom's explosion at the last second and Chase realises that Director Bones knew Atom was from another world and set it up to ensure she would be afraid of the Multiverse. When Bones tries to leave the Ark Chase shoots out his good leg and it shifts away with them both on board.

On Hammond's ship in The Bleed, the JSA attack Roy Harper, once again under the control of his Black Lantern Ring. Roy is able to resist the ring enough to ask Jade for help and she recognises him from their previous adventures together. Jade helps him overcome the ring and explains what happened to them. She called a meeting of the JSA after they were all restored to reality and X-Tract attacked, shooting them with guns that teleported them away. X-Tract's teleport beam somehow interacted with the Starheart and sent Jade into The Bleed. She broke the others out and they have been lost until they stumbled across Hammond's ship.

The Carrier Ark picks up a signal from X-Tract's ship and Jade decides to take it to it's planned destination so they can face the DEO. The ship shifts to Earth Omega and Roy realises this is where the Ring wanted to take him and that Darkseid is on the planet. They also see the Anti-Monitor's Shadow Demons and the Psycho-Pirate holding Barry Allen prisoner. They realise they are in trouble and plan to retreat back to Earth 0 for reinforcements, but before they can X-Tract's Ark materialises in the same space as theirs and both ships crash to the surface.

At the House of Heroes Harbinger picks up their distress signals but silences the alarms before Justice Incarnate hear them. Batman and Superman return from Earth 23 and meet Machinehead, who has been rebuilding the crashed Ark. Since Luthor had never been able to develop multiversal travel, Superman suspects he may have had help from another reality and asks Harbinger for details of any multiversal travel recently detected, but she refuses. Superman tries to hack into her and finds a hidden message from Barry Allen calling for help. Meanwhile, Thomas looks up the records of all the alternate versions of Batman and realises that being a hero is his son's destiny.

Superman calls the rest of Justice Incarnate to action and orders they call in all reinforcements for an expedition to Earth Omega, but Machinehead suddenly blasts them all. Earth 8 was invaded by an alternate reality years ago and its heroes lost the battle, leaving Machinehead disfigured. He has decided that all worlds in the multiverse must be kept separate and has assembled an interdimensional team of villains to ensure that there will be no more crossovers between worlds.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Frontier_Vol_1_4"
"Infinite Frontier Vol 1 5","Darkseid has offered various people around the Multiverse a deal: if they align with him, he will protect their worlds from the coming Crisis. Director Bones agreed to hand over heroes on Earth 0 who originally come from other realities so Darkseid can harness their multiversal energy, while the members of Injustice Incarnate will serve as soldiers.

On Earth Omega, everyone emerges from the crashed Carrier Arks and reunites. X-Tract tells them that they are stranded without the Carrier Arks, and reveals she is the Cameron Chase of the original Earth-Two. They see Barry Allen running in the turbine and when Green Lantern asks X-Tract what is happening, the Psycho-Pirate appears and explains that they will use Barry, the first person to ever cross from one world to another, to crack open the Multiverse, allowing Darkseid access to the power beyond. He opens a portal to summon Injustice Incarnate, along with the imprisoned members of Justice Incarnate, and the two sides battle.

The villains overpower the heroes until President Superman breaks free of his chains and flies towards the turbine. He is stopped by Machinehead, who tells him that Earth 0 is a danger to the multiverse, as every Crisis originates there. He attacks Superman with his one weakness, Meta-Nite, and reveals that the Flashpoint not only affected the history of Earth 0, but also damaged Earth 8. As such, he personally wants revenge against Barry and Thomas Wayne.

Chains of dark energy emerge from the planet's surface, binding the heroes and stretching into space as the other Earths of the multiverse appear in the sky. With them, Darkseid will seal all worlds off from each other, and the multiverse will slow to a state of entropy. Psycho-Pirate offers Roy Harper a deal, if he surrenders to the ring and joins Darkseid, they will leave Earth 0 alone and Lian will be safe. Roy realises that Lian is not on Earth Omega as he assumed and uses the ring to free the other heroes. He asks them all to save the Multiverse and Lian as the ring takes control. They attack the Psycho-Pirate, but Darkseid emerges from a Boom Tube, telling them that with Roy under his control, he now commands all reality.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Frontier_Vol_1_5"
"Infinite Frontier Vol 1 6","On Earth Omega, Justice Incarnate and the JSA battle against Darkseid's forces. Meanwhile Barry Allen continues to run in the turbine, and once he cracks open the Multiverse, Darkseid will have access to the Great Darkness beyond. To control the Darkness he needs Roy Harper, the Omega Lantern. Roy is seemingly lost to the power of the Darkness but Obsidian, drawing on his own experience, is able to help Roy break free of it.

President Superman tries to reach the turbine but is stopped by Machinehead. Batman distracts him long enough for Superman to truly take him down. Superman smashes the turbine and Barry races out of it. He shoots off into the sky and disappears, leaving cracks in reality. A gigantic explosion from the center of the cracks destroys Darkseid's energy chains and deactivates the Black Lantern Ring but leaves everyone unharmed. The cracks are gone and the villain is seemingly foiled.

Darkseid announces that his plan has failed, and that they are all doomed. Psycho-Pirate flees, claiming he is ""needed in another event"". Machinehead claims they can still find the crack in the Multiverse and demands that Darkseid keep fighting. But Darkseid simply executes him and teleports the heroes back to where they came from. At the Hall of Heroes President Superman calls in all members of Justice Incarnate to search for the crack and the Flash.

A few days later on Earth 0, Cameron Chase and Roy Harper meet up in New York City, just across the river from Titans Academy. Cameron is now Director of the D.E.O. and the JSA all made it home safely with seemingly no damage to the time-space continuum, but Earth Omega has disappeared from all sensors and Bones is in the wind. Roy meanwhile is still determined to find Lian, but has decided to first reveal himself to his friends and get back to real life.

On Earth Omega, X-Tract and the New Gods of Apokolips pledge loyalty to Darkseid. He reveals that there are many others seeking the power of the Great Darkness and that they will need everyone to play their parts in the coming wars, including the heroes who he spared.

Barry Allen awakens from the illusion and realises what is happening. He stops running and finds himself in the ruins of the Pre-Crisis Multiverse. He is met by Pariah, who tells him that everyone who has meddled with the Multiverse before was wrong and he has found another way. He disintegrates Barry and rematerializes him in a pocket dimension where he will always be happy ""No matter what.""","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Frontier_Vol_1_6"

"Nightwing 2021 Annual Vol 4 1","A viral video has emerged online seemingly showing Red Hood murdering an FBI informant and several undercover agents, even unmasking midway through to show Jason Todd's face. Nightwing goes to confront Jason, and on the way remembers their first adventure together shortly after Jason had become Robin and Alfred called him while Batman was out of town to counsel the troubled boy.

At Jason's hideout, he denies responsibility, claiming he has given up using guns. As Jason shows no bruises corresponding to the places ""Red Hood"" was shot in the video, Dick trusts him at his word and decides to help him investigate the impostor. In the sewers near the crime scene Jason finds one of the bullets his doppleganger fired. In the abandoned Batcave, the two test the bullet and find traces of clay, determining that one of the Clayfaces was responsible. Oracle informs them that ""Red Hood"" is attacking a restuarant where a known gangster is eating and the two race over in the Batmobile, taking Mr Freeze's gun with them.

They defeat Clayface and freeze him solid for interrogation. Clayface admits to working for a criminal named Wolfgang Bylsma, who was once a major drug dealer in Gotham whose tainted heroin killed 83 people and caused Jason's mother to overdose multiple times before his eyes. They rush to Gotham Airport where Bylsma is leaving in a private plane. Oracle attempts to ground it but Bylsma forces the pilot to start the engines at gunpoint. Jason rams the plane with the Batmobile while it is still on the ground and attacks Bylsma, beating him with a crowbar. At Dick's urging, Jason does not kill Bylsma, deciding prison would be a worse punishment for Bylsma than death.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwing_2021_Annual_Vol_4_1"

"The Flash Vol 1 781","Wally West meets up with his cousin Wallace West, the current Kid Flash. He tells Wallace that when he was starting out as Kid Flash, Barry Allen would only take him on a ten minute ""patrol"" of Central City every night to make him feel included, so Wally began sneaking out to fight crime on his own. Eventually he devised a route that allowed him to patrol the whole world in one night, only staying in one place for ten minutes at a time. He has continued to do this every day since, but is having trouble balancing that with his work and family and asks Wallace to take over his patrols, which Wallace reluctantly agrees to.

Wally leads Wallace on his route around the world, fighting crime but also helping people around the world in small but meaningful ways. Along the way they find a Hall of Doom under construction, which Wally says have been popping up all over the world recently. Wally sabotages the Hall, so whoever is building it will fail and have to waste money and resources starting over somewhere else. The route ends in Chicago where they pick up pizza, and Wallace thanks Wally for taking him on his route. Suddenly, a bank nearby explodes and Girder, who is supposed to be in Iron Heights, emerges. They suit up and charge into battle.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flash_Vol_1_781"
"Justice League Vol 4 75","Justice League Incarnate teleports the members of the Justice League of Earth 0 to the ruined Hall of Heroes, including Green Arrow who grabs onto Black Canary as she dematerialises. President Superman informs them of what has happened: the disappearance of Barry Allen, Darkseid's fall to the Great Darkness and the coming invasion. The Darkness attacks the House, and Doctor Multiverse teleports the two Leagues to Multiverse-2, where they find Pariah working on his Antimatter Chamber from the first Crisis, modifying it to allow the Darkness to enter the Multiverse.

Superman attempts to reason with Pariah but he refuses to listen and summons the Dark Army, a collection of cosmic villains who sought the Great Darkness' power and have been enslaved by it. The heroes engage the Dark Army and find that their enemies are not fighting with their usual skill but merely relying on their brute strength. They realise that Pariah is controlling them and with his focus split in multiple directions is unable to use them with any finesse. During the fight Black Adam hits Darkseid with his lightning and Darkseid is able to briefly break free of Pariah's control. He tells the Justice League they cannot win and tries to tell them how to survive the invasion, but the Darkness regains control before he can. Emerald Knight unleashes the full power of the Godstorm on the Army, but Pariah is able to counter with a horde of Shadow Demons and the Spectre, who has also fallen to the Darkness.

Batman tells the others that they need to destroy Pariah's Chamber, and Green Arrow is able to hit it with an explosive arrow from a great distance, narrowly flying past friend and foe alike. The Chamber is destroyed and the Dark Army disappear, but Doomsday smashes Ollie before he vanishes. Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman try to capture Pariah, but he annihilates them with a wave of energy. He then destroys the rest of the Earth 0 League except for Black Adam and Black Canary, who is cradling Green Arrow's body. Adam attempts to fight Pariah, who flies them into the air and unleashes the same energy on him, destroying the members of Justice League Incarnate. Black Adam is able to resist the energy long enough to shout ""Shazam!"", causing the lightning to strike them both. Pariah falls back to the surface of the ruined Earth, and Black Adam is transported back to Earth 0.

Jon Kent and Wally West take him to Black Adam, who tells the story of their confrontation with the Dark Army, but Hal is obviously skeptical of the former supervillain. He tells Wally to search for Barry and the missing Justice League, while he will determine if the Great Darkness is still active somewhere. With the two senior heroes occupied elsewhere, Jon decides to found a new Justice League. The new Batman and Wonder Girl reject him, but he pulls together a lineup of misfits. Jon unveils his ad-hoc League and asks Black Adam to join them but Adam resigns and returns to Khandaq. Before he leave he tells Jon that they are unfit for the challenge they're facing.

Barry tells Hal that he has been exploring the paradise worlds and believes that Pariah is using the League to power something.

On Earth 0, Deathstroke and his forces haven't been seen for almost 24 hours and the combined forces of the Justice Society, Justice League, Titans and Bat-Family appear to have turned the tide, but Mister Terrific warns that he has detected dark energy at the edge of the Multiverse and Cyborg believes that the Dark Army are on their way to Earth 0. Nightwing hasn't left Beast Boy's bedside since the attack on Titans Academy but Alan Scott tells him that the heroes need him to lead them. Meanwhile, Black Adam attempts to convince the Legion of Doom to help him, but while they are arguing the Hall of Doom is attacked by the Secret Society, now fully under the control of the Darkness.

Barry carries Hal to Batman's paradise world, a clockpunk city. Barry admits he tried to talk to Bruce before but he wouldn't listen and simply attacked. Batman appears and attacks them again, throwing gears in place of Batarangs. Meanwhile Hal and Barry's actions are only accelerating the process Pariah is using to create a new Multiverse from the paradise worlds.

Alan Scott takes Nightwing, Jon Kent and Yara Flor to the Tower of Fate to speak with Justice League Dark. The Swamp Things; Alec Holland and Levi Kamei, tell them that the Great Darkness is an elemental force neither good nor evil, and with no desire to control people. The Darkness is not acting as it should, and they believe that it has been corrupted by something.

The Secret Society manages to put up a significant fight against the Legion of Doom, and Luthor realises that the lesser villains are much stronger than normal.

On Multiverse-2, Pariah's forces have overpowered Kyle Rayner and Jo Mullein. They tell him that the Justice League will break free, but Pariah appears to hear the voice of the Great Darkness in his head telling him that when the League reunite it will trigger the new Crisis. Meanwhile in Batman's paradise world, Hal and Barry fight him while trying to make him remember the truth. Although Bruce does not consciously recognise them, he refers to Barry by name and brings out a countermeasure specifically designed to stop a Flash. Hal realises that the world they are in is breaking down and his ring is still on his finger, simply hidden by an illsuion. He regains control of his ring and uses it to create a construct of the Batman Family, awakening Batman's true memories. They leave to find Wonder Woman, as she will be integral to helping the others see the truth.

Back on Earth 0, most of the world's heroes gather at the Hall of Justice. The JSA leave to try and stop the Darkness while the Titans and their students prepare to fight Deathstroke.

Damian departs with Doctor Light, claiming he has a plan to stop Pariah. Deathstroke's forces burst into the Hall and the assembled heroes charge them.

Hal, Barry, Batman and Wonder Woman go to Superman's paradise world to rescue him, but he already knows that the world he is in is an illusion. From his perspective he has been trapped in it for years, and used that time to study the paradise worlds and learn how to manipulate them, which he demonstrates by reducing his world to a white void.

Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice, the heroes are being overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. Jace Fox arrives with reinforcements, but Pariah sends them into their own paradise worlds. Mister Terrific brings out Pariah's antimatter cannon, believing he can use it to cut Pariah off from the corrupted Darkness and remove his powers. However, Pariah sees them and sends the Dark Army to stop them. 

Jon Kent fights the entire Dark Army single-handed, while Yara Flor sneaks up behind Pariah and binds him with her Golden Boleadoras to force him to see the truth: the voice of the ""Great Darkness"" is nothing but the sickness in his own mind. However, Pariah refuses to believe it and breaks free. He attempts to banish Yara to her own world, but Jace shoots him with the cannon, which he has modified to turn Pariah's own powers against him.

Like other imps before him, Mite-Mite claims to be Nightwing's biggest fan and is overjoyed to meet his idol; plus, even though his preferred ship is Nightwing/Starfire, he's happy that Dick has found love with Batgirl. He declares that their relationship needs ""progression"" and teleports all their friends to the woods for a wedding. They tell him they're not ready to get married and he begrudgingly sends the assembled heroes back to where they came from and teleports him and Nightwing to Bludhaven.

Nite-Mite tells Nightwing that Blockbuster had a secret daughter named Olivia whose soul he sold to Neron in exchange for greater intelligence, and now that Blockbuster is dead, Neron's demons have come to collect. He can't get directly involved because it could spark a war between Hell and the Fifth Dimension, so he empowers Nightwing's escrima sticks to banish the demons back to Hell so he can save the child. Nite-Mite also brings in Haley to help Dick, outfitting her with a costume as ""Bitewing"" and giving her the ability to speak.

Nightwing and Haley break into Blockbuster's skyscraper and make their way to Olivia's room, where they find her guards dead and five demons surrounding her. They defeat four of the demons but the last one grabs Olivia and holds her hostage. Olivia reveals that she has super-strength like her father and punches the demon through the wall. 

Nightwing takes Olivia to Raven, as the powerful sorceress will be able to hide her from Neron. Olivia thanks Dick and Haley for saving her, and Dick tells her she should also thank Nite-Mite, as without him they would never have known she was in danger. She hugs Nite-Mite and thanks him too, despite him saying that he's not a hero. After Raven and Olivia teleport away, Nightwing asks Nite-Mite what his real name is, saying he shouldn't build his entire identity around someone else.

As he is running to the portal he bumps into Red Canary, a new hero who responded to Nightwing's call, and they fall through the portal together.

The others ask where they are and what the plan is but Robin, who believes he has the sole responsibility to save the Multiverse and is afraid of failing, is acting like even more of an obnoxious prick than normal. He refuses to explain himself; condescends to the others, who are all older than him; and demands that they simply obey his orders without question. He tracks a signal with a stolen T-Watch and leads them to a Cosmic Tuning Fork similar to the one used during Infinite Crisis.

Robin tells Power Girl to fly him up to a platform on the fork, ignoring her obvious discomfort at being near one again. She refuses to take him up unless he asks politely and they argue until Red Canary interrupts and points out an army of Shadow Demons in the sky. Robin has no idea what they are and so tells Power Girl to fight them and asks Doctor Light to carry him to the platform in the most sarcastic, overly polite way possible. Power Girl carries him up instead as, unlike him, she knows that Doctor Light's powers destroy Shadow Demons. Robin hacks the tuning fork while Power Girl struggles to hold the Shadow Demons off. He finds the information he needs to track the source of the Darkness controlling the Dark Army but the Demons fall back and regroup, merging together into a single giant Shadow Demon. Robin gives Sideways the next set of co-ordinates and Doctor Light, inspired by Red Canary joking that they needed a giant magnifying glass to fry the Demons, channels Power Girls' heat vision into a massive blast that destroys the giant while Sideways opens the next rift.

The team jump though the rift and emerge into a dark, wrecked room which Power Girl and Doctor Light recognise as the Monitor's Satellite from the first Crisis where the Monitor gave Doctor Light her powers. It has since been repurposed as the House of Heroes, the headquarters of Justice League Incarnate. Robin finds a terminal and goes to activate it. Red Canary warns him that it was probably shut down for a good reason and he shouldn't, but he arrogantly dismisses her and turns on the House's internal systems. This activates the Harbinger A.I., who immediately yells at him to turn her off as all her systems were devoted to external defences to keep the Dark Army out and away from the Orrery of Worlds, where they can spread the Darkness across the Multiverse. Robin tells her the Dark Army is gone, but he is proven wrong once again when Justice League Incarnate, possessed and bound in chains of darkness like the Dark Army, burst into the room.

The team fight to stop Justice Incarnate breaking into the Orrery, but even with the Multiversal Leaguers operating on brute force like the Dark Army they're clearly outmatched. When Doctor Light blasts Thunderer his chains corrode and Robin realises her powers can harm them like they can harm the Shadow Demons, although they're not strong enough to break the chains. Robin suggests she enter the Orrery herself to counter the Darkness and she dives in against Harbinger's warnings. In the Orrery, Doctor Light makes psychic contact with people across the Multiverse whose powers come from the same source and realises that, just like Pariah is connected to the Darkness, the Monitor connected her to the first Light which shone in the void when the Multiverse was born.

She emerges from the Orrery with her powers supercharged, and destroys the chains of Darkness around Justice League Incarnate with a single blast of light. Robin says they need to get back to Earth 0, as Doctor Light's fully realised powers will break Pariah's control over his army. Doctor Multiverse and Sideways combine their powers to open a rift back to Earth 0 and both teams charge through.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Crisis:_The_Dark_Army_Vol_1_1"

She sees the Shaggy Man about to attack two civilian children and throws her phone at his head to distract him. He moves on Iris, but she is rescued by Linda Park-West. Linda tells Iris that Barry is alive and Iris correctly, and ruefully, guesses that Barry left to save the world rather than coming home. The two commiserate about the troubles of being married to a superhero, when they suddenly need to dodge out of the way of a fight between Tempest and Typhoon. Iris leads Linda and the kids to the Hall's panic room, where they arm themselves with advanced weapons and fight their way out of the battle.

"Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths Vol 1 7","The two armies of heroes and villains continue to battle in the ruins of the Hall of Justice as the heroes try to reach Deathstroke, who is holding Ravager and Nightwing. Slade enters Nightwing's mind and they battle, taking on the appearances they had when they first met all those years ago. Deathstroke has been driven insane and nihilistic by his experiences with the Darkness, and believes the only way to spare his children any further pain is to destroy the Multiverse. 

Meanwhile, Pariah's infinite Earths are encroaching on the Orrery of Worlds, so even if Slade is defeated the Multiverse may fall anyway. The Flash Family race to try and repair the connections between the old universes and the new 52, but the connections are unstable. Fortunately, Robin's team return to Earth 0 with Justice League Incarnate and Doctor Light, whose connection to the light of the Multiverse should allow her to stabilise the clashing Multiverses.

Black Adam attacks Slade directly and calls down the lightning onto the battlefield. This exorcises the Darkness from Slade and distributes Adam's power across the superheroes, making them immune to the Darkness. The heroes defeat Deathstroke's army and Doctor Light and the Flashes heal the Multiverse. The Dark Army disappear while the heroes imprisoned in paradise worlds return.

Deathstroke and Adam, both powerless, fight hand to hand while Nightwing tries to resist the influence of the Darkness. Slade overpowers Adam after a hard fight and almost kills him, but Dick is able to pass through the Darkness in his mind and out of the other side, breaking free of its control. He stops Deathstroke, and the crazed mercenary charges at him, trying to force Dick to kill him, but Ravager begs him to stop and he collapses in despair.

In the aftermath, the heroes rebuild while the majority of the villains escape. Deathstroke is left a physical wreck; as removal of the Darkness also purged the serum which originally gave him his powers from his body, robbing him of enhanced physical capabilities and rapid healing. He is hospitalised at the Hall of Justice but a mysterious figure deactivates his life support and leaves him to die. Black Adam once again departs, but expresses respect for Jon Kent as he leaves. Meanwhile, Batman tells Nightwing that the League is disbanding, as he and the Titans have proven that they can stand without them.

Some time later, Amanda Waller meets with the mysterious Council of Light and asks for their help containing and controlling the superheroes. They instead offer her the resources she will need to kill every metahuman on Earth, good and evil, to which she simply responds ""Finally"".","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_Vol_1_7"
"Batman/Superman: World's Finest Vol 1 10","Joker angrily slams down various newspapers showing off Superman, Batman and Boy Thunder in action as the clown believes he knows their real identities and demands him to tell them. David still claims that he doesn't, even as he's electrocuted. Joker does stop when the Key points out he's been at it for hours, the latter chastising David for attempting to use his powers while in his cage. Joker, then hits David with a variation of his Joker Gas, causing him to hallucinate seeing Superman, Batman, Robin and himself as monsters.

In Gotham City, Superman tears through a hidden meth lab in search of David, but it's clear that the lead-lined buildings in Gotham is making it hard for him to find the boy. Batman tries to reassure Superman that he has the aid of the Teen Titans, the GCPD and himself and that he and Robin are looking into a lead through a clue left by the Key. Robin notes Superman is so angry and frustrated, Batman telling him that he's never handled anger very well, that he's mad at both the Joker and himself, telling Robin that he's feeling the same. He ultimately finds an identification mark on the item labeling it as a Lexcorp product. As he tells the heroes to meet up at a certain building, Superman snatches the two quickly and brings them there, where the other Titans are waiting. To their shock, inside the factory is a dimension of doors.

Deep within the factory, David wakes up in front of the Key as the Joker cleans and primes a crowbar. The Key explains that, as a child, he dreamed of being free to expand his mind beyond what he had, fooled and frustrated by the myth of ""only using 10% of your brain"" and that he psychochemically altered himself physically and mentally to get where he is. He learned the Joker was also something of a chemist and agreed to giving him some of his chemicals, but he keeps moving the goalposts and today it's just wanton bloodshed. In a panic, David begs for his life, explaining that he isn't even from this universe. In shock, Key realizes that he might have been given the gift to unlocking the secret of the multiverse.

In the dimension of doors, the Titans and Superman are having trouble finding the right door as they lead to various places. However, Batman points out that the Joker wears gloves, Key does not. Superman uses his microscopic vision to find the right door, allowing the heroes to bust in as the Joker is in the middle of beating David with the crowbar. Superman is able to free David, who warns him that the Key is escaping. However, when Superman follows, the door he tears open unleashes a strange beast. Robin and Aqualad give chase after the Joker when he's able to stun Wonder Girl, but David races ahead. As Superman, Speedy and Wonder Girl push the beast back into its door, Batman gets Kid Flash to rebuild the door Superman tore off.

David, meanwhile, follows the Joker into a funhouse-like dimension. Furious, David blasts the funhouse apart, upsetting the Joker. David turns his powers on the clown, torturing him as Robin and Aqualad catch up, begging him to stop. As the furious David snaps at the Joker over how he got off on his torture, he vows to kill him if he ever saw him again...

They quickly realise that in fact they are moving at maximum speed and cannot slow down. The rest of the neighbourhood had been destroyed by the blastwave when the Fraction landed, but fortunately they and their friends were saved by Jai pulling a tree in front of the house as a shield just before it hit.

At the crash site, Kid Flash and Impulse investigate the ship. The two argue and Bart attempts to phase through the wall of the ship but finds that he can't. Hatches open in the ship and tanks emerge, but Jay Garrick arrives and pulls them into cover before they are spotted. Meanwhile Wally ventures into the city and finds Barry cradling Iris' dead body. Barry is stricken with grief but Wally tells him that he needs his help and Barry puts his feelings aside for the moment. They are attacked by a flyer and split up, with the tank following Wally. Wally destroys the tank by throwing a length of rebar at it.

Jay, Bart and Wallace are cornered by a Fraction tank and squad of soldiers but Jesse Quick saves them. She tells them that she recognises the ship as the ""spire"" which she and Max saw on a parallel world while searching the Multiverse for Barry during the [[Dark Crisis]], and tells them that the invaders are the Fraction. Elsewhere, Max Mercury also sees the spire from a distance and realises what is happening, and heads into the city to rendezvous with the others. The Flash family, including Barry carrying Linda's body, all reunite at the West house.

Meanwhile at the Fraction's ship, their survey reveals an abundance of resources and an abnormally high number of [[Metahumans]] on Earth, as well as at least five Speed Force conduits within the immediate vicinity.

He also explains how the Fraction draw vast amounts of Speed Force with them when they land on a planet, which is why they are stuck at top speed. He tells them they need to flee the planet but the Flash Family are determined to stay and fight.

They realise that the spire is transmitting the Speed Force to the Fraction's technology and they need to destroy it to ""unfreeze"" the other heroes. Wally suggests that they may be able to use one of the Fraction's engines as a bomb to destroy the spire. He, Barry, Wallace and Bart install the battery from the ship in a car while Jay and Max Mercury look for a weakness in the Fractions' defences. Before they head out, Wally consoles Barry over Iris' death, and Barry tells him that they were each planning to propose during their date before she was killed.

The Flash Family assault the spire, leaving Irey behind to ""stand guard"" over the frozen heroes.

Miss Murder retreats and Irey races off to save her family.

She arrives at the spire just as the Fraction are rounding up the others. She again uses Jai to drive back the guards holding Bart, Wallace and Max Mercury and tells them that she has chosen a new codename: Thunderheart. Linda and Jesse are loaded into a tank, but the driver is is revealed to be the alien speedster in disguise.

Months later, Black Canary and Arsenal, along with Oliver's estranged son Connor Hawke who they met during the battle at the Hall of Justice, are searching for him. Mister Terrific assures them that Oliver did leave the ruins of Multiverse-2 with the others but was somehow diverted to another location. Following a lead from Red Hood they chase down a gang of unemployed henchmen into Gotham's Alleytown neighbourhood. Team Arrow easily overpower the petty crooks but one tries to get away. Just as Roy is about to shoot him, local vigilante Cheshire Cat leaps down from above and knocks him unconscious; then picks up a discarded arrow and throws it at another henchman who was about to shoot Team Arrow from behind, hitting him hard enough to lodge the arrow in his shoulder and knock him to the ground.

Cheshire Cat tries to leave quickly, but Roy reveals that they know she is his daughter Lian Harper. Lian tries to deny it but Roy keeps telling her details of her childhood. Roy tells Lian he doesn't know or care how she came back from the dead; and that it's alright if she isn't ready to come home yet, but she can whenever she wants. After a moment's hesitation Lian takes off her mask and runs to hug him. They all tearfully reunite and Roy asks her why she didn't come back when he learned who she was.

Meanwhile on the alien world, Oliver has resumed acting as a vigilante. He chases a drug dealer to the nightclub that a local crime boss operates out of and warns the man that he will keep coming after him as long as he profits off the pain of others. Oliver easily fights off the man's henchmen and he announces a bounty on Oliver's head. A Tamaranean named Troublemaker takes the deal and attacks Oliver. She recognises him as a member of the Justice League and asks him how he ended up so far from home; but he refuses to tell her and she overpowers him. Before she can kill him, Lian arrives to save him, despite him telling her to stay behind. They fight Toublemaker together and Lian eventually knocks her out with a boxing glove arrow, but only after Oliver breaks his bow over Toublemaker's head.

They return to their shelter, and over dinner Lian asks Oliver why they can't go home; but he refuses to say. She tells him it feels like there is a supernatural force keeping their family apart and Oliver says that's for the best; but then has a sudden burst of anger. He apologises to Lian and admits that he misses his family; listing Roy, Emiko and Dinah. Lian asks him about Connor and Oliver seems confused, not recognising his name until Lian tells him that Connor is his son.

Before they can discuss it further, Oracle calls them and tells them that a large portion of the Borneo rainforest has been obliterated by a mysterious energy blast and a forest fire is spreading through the remaining forest. Wally is about to run over and fight the fire but Nightwing refuses to let him go, as the dead version of him had traces of wood smoke and ashes on him, and it is very possible that he was killed while fighting the same fire.

The new leader has rebranded the cult as the ""Church of Eternity"" and calls himself ""Brother Eternity"" rather than Brother Blood. He reveals his plans to take the Church mainstream and announces a new direction: the Church will colonise other habitable worlds around the universe to  ensure the survival of the human species, funded by donations.

Oliver manages to slow their fall with a grappling hook and they land mostly unscathed. They are met by Connor and the Legion of Super-Heroes, revealing that they are on Earth in the 31st Century. Connor tells them that the Legion tracked their biometric readings and the teleporter signature to locate them and teleport them through time and space to their location. Oliver ignores the Legion and walks over to hug Connor. He tells Connor he is sorry for everything, but Connor tells him they have plenty of time to catch up, revealing that he has been in the future for months.

Back in the present, Arsenal and Black Canary battle Peacemaker and Peacewrecker. Peacemaker accidentally shoots the control panel outside Count Vertigo's cell, opening the door and deactivating his power-suppression collar. He unleashes his vertigo effect on all four of them until Black Canary knocks him down with the Canary Cry. They recover and Peacemaker offers Roy, considered the world's greatest marksman, a deal: if he can beat Peacemaker in a shooting contest, Smith will allow him to interrogate Vertigo; if he fails, he and Canary must leave. Roy agrees, despite both their female teammates telling them it is a stupid idea. Roy wins easily and orders Vertigo to tell him what he knows. Vertigo tells them that Waller is up to something big and has been gathering powerful objects, but he doesn't know where she is.

At Legion headquarters in the future, Lian tells Oliver and Connor what happened to her after she ""died"". She woke up in a lab with Amanda Waller and a mysterious archer; the two were arguing as Waller worried they were taking too big a risk but the archer insisted that Team Arrow could never be together. Lian then teleported away and spent years uncontrollably teleporting across time and space. She repeatedly tried to reunite with Roy, but every time she got close she teleported away again. She eventually gave up and settled in Alleytown, trying to forget her old life, until Roy found her and she was transported away again. Brainiac 5 scans her and Oliver and informs them that they, as well as Connor, have teleportation devices implanted in their necks like the Suicide Squad's bombs, obviously implanted by Waller. He also says he can't remove the devices because he doesn't know what triggers the displacement and he has no way of determining where they would end up if he accidentally set it off.

Brainiac shows them a ""dark energy teleporter"" like the one Oliver destroyed on the alien world, and was found near Connor when he arrived in the future. Oliver says he knows what it is, and tells Lian he believes that the archer she saw talking to Waller was him. He touches the teleporter, triggering a video message from an elderly version of himself from the future. The future Ollie tells his younger self that in his timeline a ""Great Disaster"" killed billions of people, and Team Arrow were responsible. He tells Oliver that their family need to stay apart, and he can never go home. The present-day Oliver tells the others that they can't return to their own time and that is why he destroyed the other teleporter. 

Lian refuses to believe it and tells him they can beat whatever is coming together. After a moment, Oliver says she is right and they should go home, when suddenly a giant green energy construct smashes through the wall. The construct easily restrains the Legion, Connor and Lian; and a bubble surrounds Oliver and pulls him into space. The bubble opens and Oliver points his bow at the person generating it, who is revealed to be Hal Jordan as Parallax.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_Vol_7_3"

"Green Arrow Vol 7 4","Parallax teleports himself and Green Arrow away and shows Oliver a vision of him shooting Hal Jordan at the culmination of Zero Hour. He says that Oliver ruined all his plans to truly fix things but Oliver replies that he's not ashamed of what he did and would do it again. Green Arrow says that he knows Parallax is not the Hal Jordan of his world, but is a escapee from the previous Multiverse, which Parallax admits is true. He tells Oliver that he took refuge in the future, until Ollie's future self asked for his help setting up the system that keeps Team Arrow apart. Oliver demands to see his family and Parallax seemingly teleports them to Star City in the 21st Century, where Arsenal and Black Canary are about to enter a bar. However, when Oliver tries to hug Black Canary he discovers that he is merely a projection, and that they cannot see, hear or touch him.

The bar is The Brick House, a club owned by the crimelord Brick and frequented by mid-level supervillains. Roy is confident they will be able to find Waller's ""help"" in the bar. Dinah asks who they're looking for but Roy replies that the target will find them. Brick himself confronts the two heroes for coming into his bar and the patrons close in on them, but Roy is unconcerned. Suddenly the lights go out, and when they come back on everyone but Dinah and Roy is unconscious. Cheshire is revealed to be the one who knocked out the patrons and launches herself at the two heroes, but Roy tells Jade he knows she's not going to hurt him and asks her to help him find Amanda Waller. Cheshire refuses to help, until he tells her that Lian is in danger.

Back in the 31st Century Lian asks Brainaic 5 if he can track Parallax's energy signature and Brainaic says that he can, but they can't follow because time travel is illegal in their time. Frustrated, Lian asks if what the recording of the older Oliver said was true and her family really was responsible for the Great Disaster, but Saturn Girl replies they can't give her any details of the future. Lian accuses the Legion of never actually doing anything and Brainaic tells her the Oliver Queen dies a hero protecting his family. Lian points out that whoever is behind what has happened to the Arrow family has been meddling with time and therefore they are breaking the laws the Legion is supposed to uphold then they should try to catch them.

Parallax takes Green Arrow to the ruins of Star City at some point in the near future, but he refuses to tell him exactly what year they are in. He says that this is the timeline his older self is trying to avert and what will happen if he keeps trying to get back to his family. Oliver challenges Parallax to a fistfight with no powers or weapons; if he wins, then Parallax will explain everything and take him home, but if Parallax wins he can leave Oliver trapped in the future forever. Parallax agrees and the two brawl through the ruins. When Oliver starts to win, Parallax reactivates his powers and teleports away. Suddenly, the older version of Oliver emerges from a nearby building aiming an arrow at him, and says he shouldn't be there.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_Vol_7_4"

They fly to the ruined Arrowcave and the older Oliver tells them they need to talk, but the present day Oliver can tell he is hiding something.

In the present, Arsenal and Cheshire argue about Cheshire's decision to keep the fact that Lian was alive from him. They almost come to blows when Cheshire blames Roy for Lian ""dying"" in the first place, but Black Canary breaks it up and asks Cheshire what Waller is up to. Cheshire tells them that Waller is making deals and compromises that Cheshire never thought she would, and is preparing for something bigger than the superheroes are ready for. She tells them that she will help them find Lian, but warns Roy that if he ever cared about her he will stay away from Amanda Waller. 

In the future Oliver looks over the ruined Arrowcave, and the preserved costumes of Team Arrow. He asks his future self if he really is responsible for their deaths and the state of the world, and the older Oliver said he did everything he could. They argue, with Oliver telling his future self that he didn't do enough and he would have died trying to save their family. The older Oliver tells him that the truth was he was always destined to be alone and should never have left the island, and that's why they were always so afraid of it and never went back. He unveils the time machine and tells his younger self that he will send him anywhere in time and space he wants, but he can never be with his family. 

Suddenly, Oliver shoots the other man through the eye. He tells him that he goes back to the island whenever he needs to clear his head and get perspective, but has never told anyone. The older Oliver is revealed to have a cybernetic eye and Oliver attacks him. The impostor admits that everything that has happened has been part of an elaborate scheme to make him miserable and alone. Oliver asks him who he is and the impostor replies ""your worst enemy"" and pushes him into the time machine. 

Oliver appears on a rooftop in Star City, when suddenly another version of him swoops in. He recognises the other Green Arrow as himself from shortly after he returned from the dead, due to the white feather in his cap. He confirms that the other Green Arrow is not a robot and tells him that he is from the future and someone is trying to keep them from their family. A mob of other versions of him from different points in his life swarm the rooftop, declaring that the ""last Green Arrow standing wins"". The Green Arrows all brawl until the one with the white feather shoots the present-day version of Oliver in the chest and throws him off the building.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_Vol_7_5"

"Titans Vol 4 5","The Titans subdues the demolition team in Borneo. To fix the damaged forest, they went to Levi Kamel, the Swamp Thing, for his help.

Meanwhile in the Titans trophy room on Mars, Dick and Wally came to find Linda acting strange and messing with the dangerous artifacts. Fortunately, the weapons there were all neutralized as Dick mentioned. Wally slowly approaches Linda when suddenly a creature with tendrils jumps out of her mouth heading towards him, only to be stopped by Dick. Dick mentions how the meteor retrieved from the Church of Eternity has markings indicating a creature hitched a ride to Earth, and given how future-Flash died seemingly being shot point-blank by someone close to him, he suspects the presence of mind-controlling alien parasites.

Back in Borneo,  the remaining Titans and Swamp Thing worked together to restore the burnt down forest. Starfire flew to the sky and released her energy, which is noted to be ultraviolet, imitating sunshine. Beast Boy turned into multiple insects to help restore the flora and fauna. Swamp Thing asked if Raven worries about Gar splitting his mind across many creatures at once, in which she tells him she does. She states how it concerns her that a little piece of Gar fades away if the insect he transformed is killed, yet he does not give up.

A day later, Wally, Dick and Victor reunites with the team in Borneo. The reforestation was successful. Swamp Thing was invited to become a part-time member of the Titans, which he agreed.

"Green Arrow Vol 7 6","In the present day, Black Canary and Arsenal split up, as Canary believes she has a lead on where Green Arrow may end up, leaving Arsenal to continue the search for Amanda Waller with Cheshire. Canary tells Arsenal to stay in contact with Oracle and not to trust Cheshire, but after Canary leaves Jade tells Roy that he will need to trust her if they are going to survive.

Oliver Queen falls through time, his life flashing before his eyes; when he suddenly emerges at a circus, which he remembers visiting a few months after he first got off the island. The arrow in his chest disappears and the wound miraculously heals. The impostor appears behind him and tells Oliver that he will hound and fight him through all of reality now that he knows the truth, but Oliver says he is done with this. He grabs a taser arrow from the impostor's quiver and uses it to short out the device in his neck. By doing this he catapults himself into the Timestream, and grabs the impostor to take him with him. The impostor yells that, with the device destroyed, they are trapped.

The impostor reveals his true identity: the presumed dead Malcolm Merlyn, alive but heavily scarred and with extensive cybernetics. As they cannot escape the Timestream, he decides to just murder Oliver while he is still incapacitated by the taser. Just as he is about to shoot Oliver he is knocked off his feet by an explosive arrow, fired by Connor Hawke. Connor tells Oliver they need to leave immediately, and Merlyn smugly tells Oliver that he will eventually escape the Timestream and come back to hurt Oliver's family when he least expects him. Oliver grabs Connor's bow and decides to kill Merlyn once and for all, but Connor asks him to spare Merlyn's life, and after a moment's hesitation Oliver agrees. Merlyn shoots at them and Connor dives in front of the arrow to save Oliver, but Lian also swoops in and catches it. The three of them exit the Timestream together, leaving Merlyn stranded outside time.

Oliver wakes up on a beach and assumes he's been left alone again, but then sees Black Canary on the beach. They run to each other and kiss, and Lian and Connor walk out of the jungle to join them. Canary reveals they're on Starfish Island and she has a plane to take them home. Lian suddenly realises Roy isn't with them and asks where her dad is.

Elsewhere, Cheshire leads Arsenal to one of Amanda Waller's safehouses where she keeps the ""Network"", a Dark Web information-gathering apparatus that they can use to track Lian. When they find the Network however, Roy notices that the technology doesn't look like Waller's usual equipment and realises that she is monitoring every superhero on Earth. They hear a click and Cheshire pushes Roy out of the way of a hail of bullets and is shot. Roy turns to face their attacker but is gunned down himself. Their attackers are revealed to be Waller, Peacemaker and Peacewrecker.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_Vol_7_6"

Onomatopoeia follows a handwritten note to a pier at Star City docks and pilots a boat out to sea. He rendezvous with a yacht where his employer, Brick, is waiting for him. Brick congratulates him on getting the job done and tells him he needs to get out of town before Connor catches up to him, when Connor suddenly appears chasing after them in the Arrowboat. Connor dives into the water and sends the boat to crash into the side of the yacht, crippling it and causing it to slowly sink.

Connor climbs aboard and squares off against Onomatopoeia. They fight and Onomatopoeia eventually overpowers Connor and seemingly shoots him dead. Brick attempts to flee via helicopter, saying that he hates working with weirdos like Onomatopoeia, but Amanda Waller will work with anyone. He starts climbing a rope ladder up to the helicopter, when the ladder is suddenly cut by an arrow. Onomatopoeia unmasks to reveal that he is Oliver Queen.

It is revealed that Oliver and Connor defeated Onomatopoeia and decided to fake Oliver's death, in order to track who was paying him. Connor gets up and the two of them demand to know what Waller is doing. Brick tells them that Waller offered any supervillain who killed a hero a full pardon, but so far nobody has tried to take the deal because they believed it was a trap. Brick and some other Star City crimelords decided to hire Onomatopoeia to go after the Arrows to test if the deal was legitimate. Oliver asks where Arsenal is and Brick tells him that he and Cheshire went after Waller.

Beast Boy, in the form of a Star Conqueror, has unleashed spores that threaten to transform the inhabitants into animal-like creatures. Oliver and Connor investigate the situation and discover that individuals called the Resurrection Twins have targeted Star City.

The Resurrection Twins are using the city's aquarium as a laboratory, where they are conducting experiments on mutant creatures, particularly on the spores released by Beast Boy.

"Titans: Beast World Vol 1 6","Peacemaker is recovering from his fight against Nightwing, and Amanda Waller tells him not to do anything stupid. Dr. Hate reveals herself to be the dark version of Raven, previously trapped in the gem on her forehead. But she escaped some time ago. Raven sends Nightwing through a portal to protect him and faces her evil counterpart.

In Titans Tower, Nightwing reappears. He reunites with Batgirl and Detective Chimp. The latter asks him what his plan is to stop the remaining spores. Superman Jon Kent joins them later, serving as bait to release the spore infecting Batman. Bruce regains his senses and is concerned he may have hurt Richard. He will help Batgirl/Oracle coordinate the heroes and rescue services.

Many powerful heroes are gathered. Chimp explains that they will all serve as bait to release the last infected. Cyborg, who has hacked into several government military agencies, worries about opposition from the authorities.

Nightwing visits the President of the United States. Ready to unmask himself, he asks the president to trust the Titans again, while stating that they have healed his wife. Nightwing exposes Waller and asks the president to help him contact other heads of state until the Titans arrive and heal the infected.

In Gotham, Sergeant Steel confronts several Beast-Men, including Harley Quinn in her giant muscle-bound rabbit form. But Jon Kent intervenes. He draws all the spores toward himself.

Nightwing gives Donna Troy a dossier to neutralize the heroes who might become infected during the process and cause more problems. Cyborg presents Donna with armor that should immunize her against the spores and allow her to fight on equal footing with any infected Kryptonians or Tamaraneans.

Raven is losing the battle against her evil counterpart. The latter wants the Beasts to lead the attack, but something seems to be stopping them. Garfield is apparently still somewhere within all those spores. This amuses Dark Raven, as the heroes are destroying everything that remains of Garfield. Raven telepathically asks everyone to stop killing the spores. Nightwing gives the order to lure and contain them in Titans Tower. Everyone does their part, and many people are saved.

Dark Raven gains the upper hand and nearly strangles Raven. But Starfire intervenes, seriously wounding her and knocking off her helmet. Flash (Wally West) takes advantage of the situation, grabs the helmet, and runs away with it. This enrages Dark Raven. Wally throws the helmet, which tries to corrupt him, into a volcano. Raven now fights her evil counterpart on equal terms and asks Starfire to join the others. The battle between the two women continues, and Raven is determined to trap her evil counterpart in her red crystal once again.

Later, Raven returns, having successfully imprisoned her counterpart in the gem. The spores gather again to take the form of Garfield, but Raven senses that his mind is not whole. A significant part of him has been lost with the death of so many spores.

Later, Amanda Waller announces to the public that she is opening the Hall of Order to counter the superheroes and the Titans, stating that they have no authority over this world and that there has been enough of their ""justice.""

In Titans Tower, Detective Chimp explains to Cyborg that there may be a way to fully restore Garfield. Cyborg presents the plan to the other heroes. They retrieve the severed arm of ""Garro,"" which had left with the Necrostar in the Boomerang Nebula. The heroes bring the frozen piece of Garro back to the Sahara, using their powers to melt the ice and allow Gar to merge with the arm. Donna's lasso helps the process. Garfield regains consciousness, with Raven by his side, in tears. She tells him that they won.

Later, in the shadows, it is revealed that Raven is actually trapped in the crystal, and it is Dark Raven who has taken her place. She plans to get her revenge, sooner or later.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Titans:_Beast_World_Vol_1_6"

Meanwhile, he sends Connor Hawke to Corto Maltese to bring John Diggle back to Team Arrow. Connor discovers that Diggle is in prison and bribes his way into John's cell. Diggle refuses to come with him, saying he's where he deserves to be and doesn't care what Oliver is doing, until Connor tells him they are planning to bring down Malcolm Merlyn once and for all.

At the Hall of Order, Oliver finds the Bureau of Sovereignty looting all the League's equipment and packing it up for transport. He is caught by Bright but that is what he planned, as the cyborg will take him right to Waller. Bright knocks him out and Peacemaker and Peacewrecker drag him to Batman's old interrogation room in the Hall.

Amanda Waller comes to speak with Oliver and he asks her what she's really up to, as openly seizing power and trying to take over the world isn't her usual MO. She replies that she is trying to save the world, as her experiences on Earth 3 showed her what a danger people with powers can be if there isn't someone to stop them. She also claims that Roy was arrested for breaking into her secret facility and is working for her willingly in exchange for a reduced sentence. Oliver refuses to believe it, saying she has been working with Malcolm Merlyn to hurt his family for years, and Waller replies that she helped Merlyn because he promised her that she would get what she really wanted: him.

Waller releases Oliver from his bonds and tells him that there is a war between superhumans and normal people coming. She asks him to help her defend the world from superheroes but he refuses and demands to know where Roy is. Exasperated, Waller says she will tell him everything, reunite his family and deliver him Merlyn; if he brings her the records from Sanctuary.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_Vol_7_9"

They go to Roy's last known location and find a sealed metal gate built into a mountainside. They suddenly sense danger and prepare for a fight. To their shock; Red Arrow, Red Canary and Arrowette burst out of the snow and attack them. Oliver and Connor fend off the initial assault and rally. However Mia Dearden, once again Speedy after the ""unknotting"" of the timeline, sneak attacks and shoots them both with a taser arrow.

Mia apologises and tells them that Roy instructed them to stop anyone who showed up, no matter who it was. She helps Oliver up and he hugs her, happy to see her again. The girls tell them that Roy went into the facility yesterday and the doors slammed shut behind him, and they've been unable to get them open. Oliver notices a handprint scanner by the door and realises that it is a Justice League facility. He touches the scanner and it opens, recognising him as a Justice League member. He goes in, telling the others to hold back.

Oliver heads in and finds the central computer. Roy jumps out and attacks him, believing that he is a hologram generated by the Sanctuary program. Oliver refuses to fight back, and Roy realises he is real when Oliver calls him his son. They hug and Oliver asks him why he's helping Waller, and Roy reveals that she put a teleport device in him and is holding Cheshire hostage. Oliver says they will stop Waller, but first they have to get the files as he is planning to gain her trust to bring her down.

Forty-eight hours later, Oliver reports to the Hall of Order to begin working for the Bureau of Sovereignty. Peacemaker smugly greets Oliver and tells him that one of the Bureau's black site prisons has been broken into and they want him to deal with it. Oliver refuses as his deal with Waller was that he would not be required to do field work, but Peacemaker shows him a live feed of the surveillance cameras and Oliver begrudgingly agrees.

Arsenal and Cheshire Cat infiltrate the secret prison, a facility hidden in the mountains known as ""Belle Reve North"" where Cheshire is being held. They sneak their way to Cheshire's cell, following information from John Diggle. They free her but accidentally trigger an alarm. A squad of Bureau goons rushes to the cells, and the three fight them off and run to escape through an open window.

Lian and Cheshire climb down a rope ladder which they had set up, but before Roy can go down it Oliver appears behind him in his new Bureau of Sovereignty uniform and tells him to stop. Roy asks Oliver what Waller is using to force him to work for her, but Oliver claims he is working for her of his own free will and believes that she is right. He also claims that he is no longer Green Arrow and has signed his fortune over to Roy. Roy asks Oliver to come with him, saying they can work things out, but Oliver kicks him out of the window. Peacemaker comes up and approvingly says Oliver is ""cold-blooded"", but when he looks out of the window he sees that Lian and Cheshire have caught Roy. He accuses Oliver of letting Roy getting away on purpose, but Oliver throws him into a wall and says he won't let his emotions get the better of him again.

However, as soon as the transmission ends, Roy says he's not going to do that. He leads them to a new Arrowcave under the beachhouse, and says that the only person who may know of a weakness in the new Amazos is Professor Ivo, the original creator.

Amanda Waller calls a ""war council"" at the Hall of Order to discuss how to find and capture the remaining ones. The Brainiac Queen suggests targeting their loved ones to draw them into the open, but Waller turns it down, saying that those people are civilians and it is their job to protect them. She insists that she is not a sociopath, causing Dreamer and Failsafe to shoot each other a skeptical glance. Waller instead decides to launch an assault on the Fortress of Solitude.

At the Fortress, Wonder Woman says that the first thing they need to do is pick a leader, unfortunately Aquaman, Batman and Mister Terrific start arguing as they each believe it should be them. Nigtwing interrupts and takes charge. He makes a speech to the assembled heroes, saying that Waller assumes they will fold without their powers, but her obsession with dominating the world means she can't understand that they will always selflessly fight against tyranny and injustice. He splits them into teams and starts handing out assignments: Batman will retrieve Waller's Mother Box; Superman and Zatanna will try to get help from the Multiverse; Black Canary and the Birds of Prey will extract Green Arrow; and Wonder Woman and Robin will free their imprisoned friends from Gamorra.

Superman provides the depowered heroes with the Fortress' arsenal of alien weapons and tells them that ""tactical suits"" which will replicate their powers are in production, although currently only Aquaman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Wally West's are ready. He also gives Wally a motorcycle which will replace his super-speed. While the heroes prepare, Mister Terrific begins work on a teleporter to allow them to deploy undetected. However, the cybogised Jon Kent leads the Brainiac Queen to the Fortress and they blast in. The Queen and Jon attack and Dreamer follows, opening portals which the Queen throws heroes through. 

The Titans attack Jon while Superman tries to get through to him. Global Guardian, one of Task Force VII, sneaks in through the portal and begins draining superpowers from the Titans. Zealot slices him in half but he quickly repairs himself. Superman is unable to reach Jon and so Wally incapacitates him with Kryptonite. Batman tries to get the Phantom Zone Projector, but Global Guardian snatches it away and hurls it at the wall, breaking it. Batman temporarily incapacitates Global Guardian with sonic weapons built into his suit and Wonder Woman and Aquaman throw the deactivated android through a portal. Meanwhile Dreamer watches the carnage, horrified.

Jon seems to momentarily break his programming, but this is just to lure Superman close so he can infect him with the Queen's circuitry. Wally drags Jon off Superman using his motorcycle and flies them at full speed into Blue Beetle's Bug. Jon is knocked unconscious and Wally falls off the bike.

The Brainiac Queen finds the Bottled City of Kandor and Aquaman smashes it open, freeing the miniaturised Kryptonians within. The Kandorians swarm around the Queen and start destroying her from the inside. However, she is able to generate a  burst of red solar energy and render them powerless.

The heroes who can flee through Mister Terrific's teleporter and Superman sets the Fortress to self-destruct. The Brainiac Queen grabs Superman to prevent him leaving, but Dreamer attacks the Queen, yelling at her to let Superman go. Dreamer declares that she is done with Waller's plan. The Fortress explodes, seemingly destroying them both, and Jon momentarily regains control of himself. However, the Queen rapidly reassembles herself and takes back control of him.

At Death Valley, Tomorrow Woman drops Team Arrow out of the sky but they are able to save themselves with their parachute arrows. Tomorrow Woman dives down towards them, her landing sends out a shockwave which knocks them over.

Connor approaches her and reminds her that Ivo created her to destroy the Justice League and he doesn't need Ivo. Tomorrow Woman glitches and collapses, Connor catches her and says that they will get Mister Terrific to rebuild her. Roy says they still need Ivo, and nearby the Bureau's plane takes off. Roy realises the Bureau has Ivo and they run back to the Arrowplanes. He calls Lian and Cheshire to join them, but Cheshire reveals that they are already on the Bureau carrier.

Booster arrives late just as the speech is ending, and wonders quietly to himself why he still feels so lost when he thought he would be happy.

Suddenly, violet lightning shoots through the room. Zatanna and Hal Jordan are possessed and Darkseid's voice comes from their mouths, saying that the Spectre will reveal the truth, and all the magical super-heroes start chanting ""Darkseid is"". Skeets tells Booster that there is no historical record of this happening. Omega Beams shoot out of the magical heroes' eyes, then a Boom Tube opens and Darkseid steps through; now wearing a black hooded cloak and with his hand replaced by an axe. Jordan says that if Darkseid has bonded with the Spectre, then he has become Death itself. The heroes charge Darkseid, who fights them off while seemingly having an argument with himself.

Skeets detects a rift in reality and Mister Terrific says that Darkseid is out of sync with reality, like he is breaking in half. Darkness gathers around the blank card and Skeets tells Booster that the future has changed, meaning that they may not be able to go home. Darkseid begins building some kind of gateway and Zatanna tells the other heroes that, if he succeeds, he will become all-powerful. She tells them to keep him occupied while she and the other sorcerers prepare the spell to separate Darkseid and the Spectre. Wonder Woman binds him in the Lasso of Truth while Zatanna charges Superman up with magic to carry the spell. Zatanna flies at Superman and yells ""Eerf mih!"", splitting the Spectre off from Darkseid. Darkseid says ""Thank you... Darkseid ends."", then disappears in an explosion, leaving a rip in time and space in the middle of the Watchtower. Superman says that they have their first mission.

Later, the League call in Orion to consult him and ask him where Darkseid is. He says them that Darkseid is not on Apokolips and, as far as anyone can tell, is not in the Multiverse at all. Orion tells them that Darkseid represents a universal constant, so a Darkseid must always exist; if the current one is gone, then a new one will be created to take his place. He leaves for New Genesis to speak with Highfather.

Batman and Mister Terrific examine the blank card, which has absorbed some of Darkseid's Anti-Life energies. They believe that it is now a gateway to ""the Elseworld"", one of the two poles of the Omniverse. When Earth 0 was cut off from the Multiverse the Elseworld, also known as the Alpha World, activated. Originally it was in a primordial state, but their readings of it now detect a finished world that is radiating the same energy as Darkseid. Wonder Woman says that they need to go there and investigate, but Terrific says that the world is still in flux and the flow of time is unnatural there. The only person who could go safely is somebody who has already travelled through time and is saturated with tachyons.

Booster Gold volunteers and Terrific sets Skeets to automatically open a portal back to Earth 0 in 10 minutes so that they can return home. They jump through the portal and the League immediately loses contact with them. Booster emerges from the rift without Skeets, not on the Elseworld but in the far future, and sees that it is now a second Apokolips with red skies, fire pits and Darkseid's Omega symbol everywhere. He is attacked by Darkseid and a corrupted Legion of Super-Heroes.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_All_In_Special_Vol_1_1"
"Titans Vol 4 16","On the Watchtower, Wally West discusses the Titans joining the Justice league with Donna Troy and Dick Grayson. Gar transforms into a Tamaranean Carcaline in an attempt to comfort one of the species being cared for on the watchtower. The carcaline turns into a giant monster and begins to attack due to the species being extremely territorial. Roy Harper then steps in and shoots the creature with an electricity gun, stunning the carcaline. The Question reprimands Beast Boy for acting recklessly and the Titans decide to reconvene back at Titans Tower. Wally then tells the Titans that he's leaving the team to focus solely on the Justice League. 

The Titans return to Titans Tower. When Donna looks at the Tower, she experiences deja vu and sees the Tower and the Titans in a flashback to the beginning of the Teen Titans. The team goes inside, and Nightwing announces that he is stepping down as leader of the Titans and having Donna take his place. Koriand'r, Victor, Gar, and Raven all agree with the decision, with Roy expressing unhappiness over the changes in the team since their early days. He begins to see flashbacks, first of himself fighting with Oliver and then him using drugs. He then realizes that something is affecting his mind, forcing him to recall his worst memories. Starfire is then affected by the same force, remembering being tortured as a slave. Raven sees a memory of her father Trigon calling her to him and lashes out with her powers, striking the Titans and sending them flying through the room. 

Roy sees the Clock King, and he reveals that he is the cause of the Titans reliving their memories. Clock King kicks Roy in the face, knocking him unconscious, and declares that the Titans' time is up. Donna gets up and confronts Clock King, determined not to let him take the Titans without a fight.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Titans_Vol_4_16"

"Titans Vol 4 17","Donna prepares to attack Clock King but before she can he uses a device to stop her and knock her unconscious. Clock King then thinks about his time working with Amanda Waller on the Suicide Squad, during which he was exposed to power that caused a growth in the area of his brain that controls memory and perception of time. 

The Titans wake up strapped in chairs with equipment on their heads that dampen their strength and willpower so that they will be weak enough for Clock King to go through their memories and learn everything about them. Trapped in their memories, the Titans fight their worst battles over and over again. Clock King enters Donna's memories, where she is once again about to attack Clock King in Titans Tower. Clock King tries to force her to go to an older memory, but the memory turns back just a few moments, to when Nightwing asks Donna to take his place as leader of the Titans. Clock King is at first confused, then understands that Donna is afraid of failing the Titans. Donna confirms this, but then says that because of that fear it was the easiest shared memory to return to with all the Titans in one place. Together they move into Clock King's memories, and see the doctor telling him about the growth in his brain, before the team breaks out of the power dampening equipment when it overloads and catches fire. Donna offers to help Clock King with medical care for his brain growth, but Clock King flees, and the Titans stay behind to extinguish the fire.

In Noonan's Bar, a figure in the shadows speaks to Clock King, who sits at the bar with a drink. The shadowed figure tells Clock King that he moved too soon and didn't respect the Titans as the formidable adversaries they are. The figure steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be Deathstroke, and tells Clock King that they can begin defeating the Titans by working together.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Titans_Vol_4_17"
"Titans Vol 4 18","The Titans move into an underground Titans Tower base in New York City. Some of the Titans disagree with Donna's decision to move there instead of moving into the Justice League Watchtower, especially Roy who is the most vocal about his complaints. The team bickers, on edge from the move, until an alarm sounds due to a disturbance in Manhattan. 

The Titans head out to find Mammoth and Shimmer, the Flinders Twins, causing chaos on the streets. Mammoth claims that the Titans have made Shimmer go crazy and that's why they are attacking. Due to reincorporating parts of her personality back into one, Raven is exceptionally affected by the emotions of the people around her, and she is paralyzed by the fear from citizens caught in the crossfire. Roy redirects her to feel Mammoth's anger instead and she begins attacking Mammoth. Donna scolds Roy for manipulating Raven. The Titans attack the Twins, and Gar transforms into a giant gorilla and knocks Shimmer unconscious. Mammoth begs the Titans not to kill his sister, and Donna promises to help Shimmer. Mammoth doesn't believe Donna and escapes into the sewer, promising to come back for his sister and for revenge on the Titans. 

In a nearby building, Clock King and Deathstroke watch the Titans. Clock King reveals that he caused Shimmer to relive her memories of the Titans attacking her over and over, according to Deathstroke's plan to separate the twins to make Mammoth easier to recruit to his newly re-formed Crime Syndicate.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Titans_Vol_4_18"

"Justice League: The Omega Act Special Vol 1 1","Many years before Krypton's destruction, Lara Lor-Van and her friend Ursa were exploring an abandoned part of the planet. This terrain was littered with the ruins of an ancient facility and the friends were exploring this place for fun, as Lara was due to join the Kryptonian archives while Ursa would soon begin her training at the military academy. The facility Lara and Ursa had entered was actually a spaceship from a time in which Kryptonians were allowed to travel to outer space and interact with other species. Within the ruins, Ursa finds a datapad that contains information about an ""ultimate weapon"", a soldier of some kind that had been created within this ship.

As they continue exploring the ruined ship, Lara and Ursa are attacked by quadrupedal creatures covered in spikes and to elude them, the Kryptonian women descend deeper into the ship and find a room filled with mysterious objects that Lara identifies as contraband from foreign worlds. Within the room, they stare at a wall emblazoned with Darkseid's symbol and a heart-like object that whispers ""''Darkseid is''"".

Lara and Ursa dodge the spiked creatures, leave the ruined ship and promise to take the secrets they have learned to the grave. The ship's occupants were creating a weapon that could be used to defeat a dangerous enemy but Lara realizes that the information in the ship did not say ""ultimate weapon"", but rather ""absolute champion"".

In the present, almost every member in the Justice League had gone to the Watchtower to listen to the meeting between the Justice League and the Time Trapper, who begins to believe that perhaps this gathering was a mistake and he should leave, but Booster Gold believes the Justice League is entitled to whatever information the Trapper holds. The Trapper pauses time around Booster and himself just so that he can take his leave, but Booster gets angry and insists that the Trapper tells the League everything he knows. Booster thinks the League can change whatever future the Trapper has seen and the Trapper opens a portal to the future so they can evaluate the threat Darkseid represents. The Flash, immune to the time pause thanks to his super-speed, follows them.

The portal leads the travelers to the future inhabited by the Justice Legion Alpha but the heroes from that time are fighting a losing war against the Legion of Darkseid and the Trapper reveals that multiple futures are under attack from Darkseid's forces and Darkseid will soon turn his attention to the present. Flash and Booster believe they should try to help out, but suddenly, they are attacked by the Legion of Darkseid. Tired of running, the Trapper demands that the Legion take him to their master so he can personally find him, but Flash says they should lead the Legion to a place where even Darkseid cannot go. Booster unleashes a blast of Omega energy that temporarily paralyzes the Legion and the Trapper thinks that this power could be key in holding Darkseid off. With time broken, the Trapper cannot take Flash and Booster back to the Watchtower, but Flash combines his power to that of the Trapper and the travelers enter a place beyond time that allows them to return to the Watchtower, moments before they left it. After everything they have seen, the Trapper believes Darkseid to be unbeatable but Booster believes the Trapper is keeping something important from them and wants to know what does the Trapper fear.

The Trapper reveals that he was created to be a weapon against Darkseid but now, he realizes that he must be armed by someone else and Booster convinces him to talk to Superman because, whether they like it or not, the future is coming. The Trapper lets time take its natural course and tells Superman that the only way to stop Darkseid is to work together.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Justice_League:_The_Omega_Act_Special_Vol_1_1"
"DC K.O. Vol 1 1","''Clark and Lois have invited Bruce and Diana to their apartment to play a tabletop game created by Wayne Enterprises. Although Lois, Bruce and Diana are excited, Clark does not like playing games in which even a single person stands a chance at losing. They play for a full hour, but suddenly, the sky turns red and fire starts to burn across Metropolis. The heroes stare outside the window and witness as Darkseid begins his warpath not just across Earth, but across all of reality. Darkseid's plan to achieve unlimited power has succeeded, for he is more than just a god now. He is godhood itself and exists in multiple locations of the universe at once, like Themyscira, the Rock of Eternity and Oa.''

''Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman join the battle but they do not last long against the Dark Lord of Apokolips. Batman and Wonder Woman are the first to fall, and Superman tries a desperate charge against Darkseid, only to be stopped by a terrible sound that distracts him from an attack from Darkseid that utterly annihilates him.''

This was just a vision of future, however, granted to the Justice League by the Quantum Quorum, a collection of extratemporal entities like the Time Trapper, Alpheus the World Forger, Booster Gold and Gorilla Grodd. They have been observing Darkseid's multiversal conquest and the Trapper says that Darkseid has conquered the future and started to conquer other time periods. He does, however, suggest a solution: restart the timeline. The Quantum Quorum could use the last of their power to create a new timeline and let the inhabitants of the multiverse escape Darkseid's grasp, similar to what an [[Jonathan Osterman (Watchmen)","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_K.O._Vol_1_1"

"Justice League Unlimited Vol 2 14","Mister Terrific and what is left of his team continue to traverse the bowels of Hell and find themselves in an area of complete darkness. Superman extends his bioelectric aura to illuminate their path beyond a few steps and the team is surrounded by damned souls. As the heroes move ahead, Aquaman senses water nearby and the team finds Charon, ferryman of the dead. Terrific, having learned of the legends about Charon, offers coins so his team gets safe passage across the River Styx, only for Charon to reject payment.

Charon says that the tokens Terrific is carrying have no meaning because the Leaguers are not really dead and if they want to travel across the river with Charon, they will have to offer him items with personal meaning to them. Tim offers a Batarang, Owlwoman relinquishes her cryogun, Gold Hawk gives up his Ntm metal medallion, Doctor Fate gives up her bracelets and Aquaman gives up his hook. They are surrendering those objects because they know that without them, their journey will be much more difficult. Mister Terrific and Superman have nothing physical to give, but Charon takes a fragment of their spirits.

Charon vanishes the ""Fair Play"" tattoos on Terrific's arms because they represent his dedication to equality and fairness in all matters. For Superman, Charon takes his unwavering determination and sense of hope. Aquaman believes Charon is asking too much of Superman, but Superman accepts if it helps his friends on their journey. Once the transaction is complete, Superman feels cold and unable to move forward without the help of his friends.

The journey across the Styx begins and the heroes find it quiet and peacefully, somethiing that makes Aquaman uneasy. Suddenly, the boat is attacked by monsters and, as the heroes attempt to defend themselves, Aquaman jumps overboard and tries to control the largest beast he can find it so his friends can escape. Once his friends put distance between the monsters and themselves, Aquaman and the beast emerge from the water. The monster is bloodstained and injured, giving the impression that Aquaman stands victorious, only for the beast to use his last moments in life to spear Aquaman through the torso with its horns. The heroes disembark from the boat and have no time to mourn for their fallen friend, as Terrific reminds them of their mission.

At the Watchtower, the Justice League continues overseeing Earth's total evacuation and Red Tornado informs the League that a small group of supervillains is still at large and causing trouble on behalf of the demon Neron. Some Leaguers will be assigned to Earth and help with the capture of those villains, while others will be relocated to the League's lunar outpost to oversee the evacuation alongside the Titans. Unfortunately, that plan hits a roadblock when Ted Kord informs Tornado that the Watchtower's boom tube has malfunctioned and all the League's shuttles have already been deployed, which means the Leaguers are stranded in the Watchtower.

Ted and the Challengers of the Unknown work hard to repair the boom tube, until the Watchtower suffers a power outage. According to the Challengers, the Watchtower's energy core has been overtaxed after distributing too much power to auxiliary facilities and evacuation ships scattered across the galaxy. Unless a solution is found soon, nobody has a chance at surviving.

Kid Flash, Martian Manhunter and Doctor Occult make their way to Oklahoma City, just in time for Mary Marvel to link up with them. Once the team arrives at the city, they find a church littered with graves. Inside the church, a priest speaks about the blessings of the angel Neron and how the people of Earth can find salvation if they offer their souls to him. The scared survivors agree to give up their souls, but Kid Flash punches the priest, who is revealed to be the Atomic Skull, a servant of Neron. This gathering was actually an ambush, and the villains, calling themselves ""the Holy Army of Neron"" attack the unprepared heroes.","MISSING","null","https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited_Vol_2_14"
